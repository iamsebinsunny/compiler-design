The code begins by importing necessary modules: os, re, and sys.
The code defines a set of token types using constants. These token types represent different elements of the programming language, such as keywords (IF, ELSE), operators (PLUS, MINUS), punctuation (LPAREN, RPAREN), and so on.
A list called token_patterns is defined, which contains regular expression patterns for each token type. These patterns will be used to tokenize the input code.
The code defines a function called tokenizer that takes the input code as a parameter and returns a list of tokens. It iterates over the input code, matches patterns defined in token_patterns, and creates tokens accordingly. Whitespace tokens are ignored.
The function is_digits is defined to check if a given value is a valid numeric value. It tries to convert the value to a float and returns True if successful, otherwise False.
The function analyzer is defined to analyze and interpret the tokens generated by the tokenizer. It initializes an index and a value table, which will store variable names and their corresponding values.
The analyzer function iterates over the tokens and performs different actions based on the token types.
It checks if a token represents a variable declaration (INTEGER_TYPE, FLOAT_TYPE) and analyzes the assignment statements accordingly.
It handles the PRINT_KEYWORD token and prints the corresponding values or strings.
It handles the DEF_KEYWORD token and analyzes function definitions.
It handles conditional statements (IF_KEYWORD, ELSE_KEYWORD, ELIF_KEYWORD) and while loops (WHILE_KEYWORD). It analyzes the condition and executes the statements inside the corresponding blocks.
It handles function calls by analyzing the arguments and printing the result.
The check_condition function is defined to evaluate and check the validity of a condition expression.
The code defines the analyze_loop_statement function, which is currently calling the analyze_if_statement function.
The analyze_print_statement function handles the printing of values or strings based on the PRINT_KEYWORD token.
The analyze_if_statement function handles the analysis of if-else and while blocks. It checks the condition, executes the statements inside the block, and handles nested blocks.
The analyze_function_definition function handles the analysis of function definitions. It checks the function name, parameters, and the body of the function.
The analyze_statements function handles the analysis of statements that involve variable assignment.
The code initializes a value table and begins the execution of the compiler by calling the analyzer function with the tokens generated by the tokenizer.
The code outputs information about the execution process, such as successfully defined functions, analyzed blocks, and error messages for syntax or runtime errors.
The code handles various syntax errors by printing error messages and exiting the program.
The code increments the index appropriately while analyzing tokens to ensure the correct flow of execution.
The code prints the value table, which stores variable names and their values, for debugging or reference purposes.
The code makes use of the eval function to evaluate condition expressions by replacing variable names with their corresponding values from the value table.
The code uses regular expressions to match and tokenize the input code based on the patterns defined in token_patterns.
The code includes comments throughout to provide explanations and descriptions of the code.
The code seems to have an incomplete implementation for the analyze_loop_statement function, as it currently calls the analyze_if_statement function.
The code lacks error handling for situations like undefined variables or function calls with incorrect arguments.
The code does not support more advanced language features such as nested functions, classes, or modules.
The code does not generate any executable code or perform any actual computations; it mainly focuses on analyzing and interpreting the input code based on its syntax and semantics.
